#CONIKS Protos

##Introduction
CONIKS is a key management service that provides consistency and privacy for end-user public keys. It protects users against malicious or coerced key servers which may want to impersonate these users to compromise their secure communications: CONIKS will quickly detect any spurious keys, or any versions of the key directory that are inconsistent between two or more users. Nonetheless, CONIKS users do not need to worry about or even see these protocols, or the encryption keys, as CONIKS seamlessly integrates into any existing secure messaging application.

These are protobuf sourcefiles that define the message format for all communication between the CONIKS test client and the basic server. They are based on [Google Protobufs](https://github.com/google/protobuf) (proto2) and require you to have the protocol buffer compiler protoc installed.

##Using the Protobufs
### Editing
Extensive documentation on developing protocol buffers can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

A few additional quick tips:
- A .proto file can define multiple protobuf messages. In our case, *c2s.proto* defines all messages specific to communication between CONIKS servers and clients, and *util.proto* defines messages included in several different c2s protos.
- All fields of a protobuf should be optional or repeated (but never required). The official Protocol buffer documentation explains:
>**Required Is Forever** You should be very careful about marking fields as required. 
> If at some point you wish to stop writing or sending a required field, it will be problematic 
> to change the field to an optional field â€“ old readers will consider messages without this 
> field to be incomplete and may reject or drop them unintentionally. You should consider 
> writing application-specific custom validation routines for your buffers instead. 
> Some engineers at Google have come to the conclusion that using required does 
> more harm than good; they prefer to use only optional and repeated. However, this 
> view is not universal. 
- All .proto files for CONIKS should use **org.coniks.coniks_common** as their java_package, should use the same package, and reside within the same directory. This will make compilation a lot easier and avoid certain bugs.

### Compiling into Java
Assuming you have protoc installed, run the following command from this directory for each .proto file you want to  compile into Java:
```
protoc --proto_path=. --java_out=../coniks_common/src <file>.proto
```
This command will automatically place the generated Java code in the appropriate package hierarchy in coniks_common/src.
